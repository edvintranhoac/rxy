The `rxy` package helps compute and explore correlations between variables.

The package has one main function to screen out predictor variables that have a non-significant relationship with the outcome variable in the specified formula.

```{r setup}
library(rxy)

# Correlate medv with the rest of the variables in the Boston dataset

library(MASS)

x <- ryx(Boston, y = "medv")

# Print results
print(x)

# Summarize results in words
summary(x)

# Plot results
plot(x)
```
